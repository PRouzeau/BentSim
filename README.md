# BentSim
Recumbent Simulator

This OpenScad application is intended to make blueprints and 3D model of
 a recumbent bike, trike or quadricycle with full geometry and steering.
 It does now have a module to create a segmented fairing, in the same style
 as aircraft aluminium fuselage

It is mainly thought for human powered cycles, but you can also use it
 for larger motorised machines.
 
See the 'Images' directory for output examples.

It simply generate the blueprint and no calculations (except trail and wheel
flop) are done.

This extended version correct the error of steering arm representation in
 former 'Trike-geometry.scad'.
 
Details in "Readme_first.txt"

It uses OpenSCAD as 3D modeler engine.
