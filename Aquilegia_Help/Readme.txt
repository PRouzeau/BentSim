This directory contains the whole BentSim help system, as published on my site
 at the address:
http://rouzeau.net/bentsimh

If you have no access to the web, you can visualize locally BentSim help by running
a local web server.
The miniweb server (written by Stanley Huang) you can find in this directory is a
 Windows version of a very simple web server.
To see locally the BentSim help on a Windows machine, just click on the 'miniweb.bat'
(NOT miniweb.exe), then open any browser and in the address bar, type:
http://127.0.1.1:8000

This will start BentSim help system. However, this minimal server is not very fast and
 struggle somewhat with image viewing. If any trouble, don't hesitate to reload a page,
 this may unlock image viewing.
 
Miniweb is a quite old software (last revision in 2013) which no longer seems
 to be maintained, but it is light and simple, you can find it here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/miniweb/
