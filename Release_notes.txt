*March, 30, 2021
- Creates an help manual with my own app 'Aquilegia' - English only - beware that OpenSCAD menus have evolved and screens copies are according new version. Minor improvements to the Aquilegia help engine.
- Delta trike tilting system, Jetrike style, that I did following test of one
- Single sided rear arm possible - not very detailed. 
- Indirect front wheel drive possible. 
- Trike steering Ackermann compensation is now adjustable (required for not vertical pivot axis - say all modern vehicles...)
- Add possibility to MANUALLY adjust right/left steering to validate Ackermann.
- Wheels can now be casted (3,4,5,6 or 8 spokes)
- Added optional suspension fork (and an experimental articulated 'Lefty').
- Added examples and updated all others. 
- Grouped Knuckle/Fork data in a new tab. 
- U-bar can now be bended in its center (for under seat use, as I tested on my Velassi).
- Can add mid-drive motors -Tongsheng TSDZ2 and Bikee 'The lightest',supposedly available in summer 2021 -. Some examples incorporate them (with batteries)
- Wheel spokes are now asymetric if there is a dérailleur transmission.
- Stays bends angle are now adjustable. 
- Can now have user programmed forks and frame. This needs to create an OpenSCAD program.
- Color of rim, hub and spokes can be modified (unique for all)
- Boom have now the same section profile as frame tube (so now can be rectangular)
- Improvements in Customizer dataset management macros 
Fixes:
- Rans seat viewing problem solved. 
- Tire color now have effect

*February, 26,  2020:
– Add the ‘release notes’ file
- Added two seats: ICE mesh seat and Hardshell seat (fictive) – Examples modified with these news seats
- Added possibility to create a fairing in segment, like aircraft aluminium fuselages
- Wheels can now have a fairing
- Possible to show two crank arm and legs position, to estimate clearance within fairing
- Frame: Trike cross angles definitions revised, one angle is deprecated
- Frame: Bottom bracket on boom can be verticaly offset from the boom, like done on some velomobiles with a support bracket.
- Rear transmission can now be simple speed/gearbox driven

The fairing calculation time is significant. First calculation may take 1 minute on an old desktop. When developing a fairing, you may:
- Cancel automatic preview (top left of customizer panel)
- Cancel the display of the nose (setting 0 as first number in fairing display array), which is the longer part to calculate, and end the design with the nose.

Driver (cyclist) revision:
- Torso much more realistic, with back camber and shoulder blades
- Neck articulation revised
- Head proportions revised, with head size variable with overall size (with size ratio powered by 0.4: Headsize = headstandard*SizeRatio^0.4). This means a rider of 80% size of the standard will have a 91,5% head size from say ‘standard’
- Limb and torso thickness proportions revised (with size ratio powered by 0.6:  Thickness = thicknessStandard*SizeRatio^0.6). This means that a rider of 80%  size from standard will have a 87.5% limbs and torso thickness of the ‘standard’.
This gives much better proportion evolution with size, the smaller size looking more as children than dwarfs and larger size having better evolution either.
- Foot size is proportional to leg length.
- When changing size, the driver move slightly to/from seat to take into account limb thickness changes, so the real reference attach is the seat.

Unfortunately the better torso shape add significant time calculation in the model, depending your computer power. Alone, a rider need 5 second calculation time on an old desktop. Complex models may need 10 to 15 seconds to be calculated first.

Examples:
Added three faired examples:
- 1 Velomobile trike
- 1 Streamliner (bicycle)
- 1 faired trike with front box, ‘Cargomobile’ (named coined by ‘Diagonale’ on the french forum Velorizontal).

- Removed ‘Pocket’ trike, replaced by ‘mini trike’ foreseen for children and very small people.

==November, 14, 2019 issue 
- Add rear suspension, miscellaneous bug corrections
*November, 10, 2019 issue
- The program was extended and renamed as ‘BentSim’, adding more complete modelisation and the capability to design a monotube Frame. It was correcting a mistake in the geometry. First seat is Rans Mesh seat. New model elements (Seat, handlebars, Lights) were issued from the ‘Velassi’ model. Significant work was done to improve the rider model accuracy. Front Fork is a new design.

*October, 4, 2019 issue
– Miscellaneous bug correction and improvement

*August, 10, 2019 First issue.
- BentSim was first issued as "Trike-Geometry", producing only geometry blueprint. Program core written from scratch, but wheels and rider models were issued from the model I did to built the first version of my "Velassi http://rouzeau.net/TheVelassi/TheVelassi" recumbent, program which was never publicly released.
